> We aim to...[improve on the previous study]...by using the much more accurate and well-validated accelerometer based physical activity, to initially calibrate the ambient sensor systems.

## The Proposal

**This course project aims to develop a calibration algorithm to improve the accuracy of heart rate data collected by a Garmin wearable using clinical research-grade heart rate data in a driving simulator study.**

## The Analysis Plan

::: incremental
- Are the data really different?
- Use high frequency ECG to impute Garmin data
- Develop a model with ECG and predict new Garmin data
- Use some math I don't yet understand:
  - Transfer learning
  - Gaussian Process Regression from the paper

## Thank you!
