# Studying the Effect of Long COVID-19 Infection on Sleep Quality Using Wearable Health Devices: Observational Study

The study design for this paper was simple and effective; I did enjoy the thorough
description of the experimental design considering the difficulties of working
with COVID data. What was surprising was that for the data analysis, the correlations
between sleep phases and biometrics, while significant, were all incredibly small. Additionally,
I have heard that it is generally inadvisable to dichotomize continuous data
(dividing cohort into High HR and Low HR); I'm not sure why they wanted to do this.
That being said, the finding that COVID patients had reduced deep sleep is sensible
(and in my own experience, probably true!) It would make the most sense that
while ill, people tend to sleep more, but have more disturbances from coughing or
having trouble breathing, or other symptoms, that would prevent them from achieving as
much _deep_ sleep as normal.

# Identifying Behavioral Phenotypes of Loneliness and Social Isolation with Passive Sensing: Statistical Analysis, Data Mining and Machine Learning of Smartphone and Fitbit Data

Generally, the idea of intervening on loneliness seems a little far-fetched to me.
Loneliness isn't something the individual is always totally in control of. Of
course, cognitive reframing of _why_ they are lonely and what they _can_ do about
it are ultimately important, but part of cognitive therapy is often about accepting
the limitations of ones locus of control. Detecting loneliness might be well
and dandy, but if the cause of loneliness is outside of the individual's locus
of control, then what is the ultimate recourse?

Otherwise, this I additionally don't know why they dichotomized a continuous measure; if you have that data
why would you want less of it? Nevertheless, the methods were impressive and comprehensive
and it was good to see a different feature extraction approach being used with
ensemble modeling. They didn't report if just throwing all the features at it worked
better, so I'm assuming this method was best.
