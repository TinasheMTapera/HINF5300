# Wearable Fetal ECG Monitoring System from Abdominal Electrocardiography Recording

This is another great paper for women's health. I found it most interesting that
the team were ready to implement this in real world settings, as I'm just learning
that you can measure two QRS signals in one! It must be incredibly difficult to
decompose an already extremely noisy signal into multiple sources!
The quality of the results is actually astounding and promising for maternal
health. I don't think it's incredibly vital that the standing results be that
high considering that most people would probably want to sit or lay down while having
a diagnostic procedure anyway. Overall, a great paper to read. Not many comments other
than that it's really cool!
