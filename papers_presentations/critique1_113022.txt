# Fluctuations in behavior and affect in college students measured using deep phenotyping

This was a denser paper than expected, but a good read nonetheless. In the paper,
the researchers used "deep phenotyping" to try and parse out behavioral patterns
in the experimental cohort. The patterns included sleep and actigraphy from wearables,
and a pretty exhaustive self-report delivered once a day. One wonders why they opted for a
single self-report per day, as opposed to multiple, when trying to balance burden.
The results were not unexpected: sleep and wake time showed variable patterns as the
semesters went on. When clustered, it was interesting to see the relationships
between sleep quality, duration, and procrastination. It would seem that while
duration is not significantly correlated to procrastination, quality is strongly.
Energy is not correlated with sleep duration, but is more correlated with sleep quality.
To me, the take home seems that we should all be getting _better_ sleep, not necessarily
_more_ sleep.
